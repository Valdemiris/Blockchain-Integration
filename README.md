# Blockchain Integration Package

This package provides utilities for integrating with blockchain networks, focusing primarily on Ethereum. It allows you to deploy smart contracts and interact with them using JavaScript.

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```bash
npm install blockchain-integration
```

## Usage

### Deploying a Smart Contract

```javascript
const BlockchainIntegration = require('blockchain-integration');

// Deploy contract
BlockchainIntegration.deployContract().then(() => {
    console.log('Contract deployed successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error deploying contract:', error);
});
```

### Interacting with the Deployed Contract

```javascript
const BlockchainIntegration = require('blockchain-integration');

// Interact with contract
BlockchainIntegration.interactWithContract('0x...').then(() => {
    console.log('Contract interaction successful.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error interacting with contract:', error);
});
```

Replace `'0x...'` with the actual address of the deployed contract.

## API

### `deployContract()`

Deploys a smart contract to the connected blockchain network.

### `interactWithContract(contractAddress)`

Interacts with a deployed smart contract using its address.

- `contractAddress`: The address of the deployed smart contract.
